# Tavro Development Environment

This environment pulls in the `admin`, `app`, and `api` repositories to build a unified environment where all three are shared on the same physical VM.

The structure is setup such that you can run them in isolation instead of desired, but this is setup for brevity and simplicity for less powerful workstations.

## Getting Started

Clone this repository and the submodules with the following command:

    $ git clone git@bitbucket.org:zoadilack/tavro-dev-env.git --recursive
    $ cd tavro-dev-env && vagrant up

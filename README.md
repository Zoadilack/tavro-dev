# Tavro Local Development

This aggregate repository builds a local virtual machine using Virtualbox, Vagrant and Ansible to provision a comprehensive environment with `admin`, `api`, `phpunit`, `docs` and `app` hosts.

There are two options to build and work; Vagrant, and Docker. Docker is greatly preferred, but has significant drawbacks on Windows machines.
